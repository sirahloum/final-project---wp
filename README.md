# HTML and CSS Starter Template

This a working progress HTML and CSS starter template for our wp101 (Web Programming) course. We will continue to develop this, and be slowly adding reusable code to it.

For now if you like, you can fork and a copy of yours and you can be working on that one directly.

## How start using it

In order to get started: 

- duplicate the folder, 
- rename it to what ever you are about to do.
- update the title in the `index.html` file
- link the two css files `base.css`  and `main.css` respectively
- gather all the images your need for you work and put them into the images folder.
- start coding your content in the `body` element
